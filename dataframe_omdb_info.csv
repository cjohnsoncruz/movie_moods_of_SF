A lot of Burners come seeking something - either a better knowledge of themselves or the world in general. I liked how it focused on the personal growth aspect instead of the usual nakedness, drugs &amp; sex.A major weakness though is the focus on the specific group of first-time Burners. These people didn't add a lot to the film I found and weren't really representative - they never seemed to really catch the Burner spirit. At best their stories were just boring - and at worst they remind me of self-absorbed winers they get on Survivor or the Real world (especially since they seemed to be a purposely diverse group thrown together in a rather contrived way).

The project is conceived and led by one of the producers, Cynthia, but her boss, NWBC president Whitaker, will take the credit if it succeeds, and let her sink as the captain of the ship if it fails. The network is rebranded EdTV when Cynthia believes she's found her subject, Ed Pekurny, a native Texas hayseed, who fits the two main criteria that she is looking for in the person: he is easy on the eyes, and he has what seems to be a potential trainwreck of a life in that he he is thirty-one years old, spends most of his time hanging out at the bar, and has no ambition beyond his longtime dead end job as a clerk in a video store. Ed did not actively campaign for the job - his blowhard of a brother Ray was the one who played to the cameras when Cynthia's team was looking for subjects - but ultimately decided to do it after discussing it with those close to him, namely his immediately family of his mother, stepfather, and two siblings. After a slow start and despite some people associated with Ed hamming it up to the cameras in wanting their fifteen minutes of fame or more, Ed becomes enough of a toast to the TV watching public for the network to become a success. However, having the cameras rolling during certain times may not be the most advantageous for those directly involved, especially as someone from Ed's distant past reenters his life, and an issue with regard to Ray's relationship with his current girlfriend, a UPS delivery person named Shari who if Ed was being honest would admit that he is attracted to himself. Other issues that eventually do emerge is Ed and those around him using the cameras as a convenient excuse for things that happen, and as Whitaker, against Cynthia's wants as the moves being totally self-serving, begins to manipulate Ed to make EdTV more salacious TV viewing.",English,United States,1 win & 1 nomination,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2UzMzljOGEtZjYzZS00ZmNmLTg4NzctYWI2NDI4NjEwOGEwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.1/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '63%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '48/100'}]",48,6.1,"45,407",tt0131369,movie,,"$22,431,897",,,True,1999,Edtv,,

Coming upon an anti-drinking missionary group, Johnnie makes them a proposition which will benefit them all. He stages a series of street carnivals in front of the saloons which attracts the crowds, especially when Beulah performs cooch-dance, to the ruination of the juke-and-gin mills.

However, he focuses more on his corporate raiding pursuits with his partner in crime, Philip Stuckey, his lawyer of ten years, than those women, with every significant other he's had in his life feeling neglected and eventually leaving him, this fact about which he is just coming to the realization. In Beverly Hills, Edward, in needing that woman on his arms as he and Philip work toward taking over the company owned by the increasingly insolvent James Morse, decides, based on a chance encounter, to hire Hollywood Boulevard hooker Vivian Ward as his escort for the week 24/7. He does so because he wants to have a professional who would be committed to the work, yet not have any commitments to her after the week is over. Beyond their chance encounter, he also makes this decision because she surprises him about how unhookerish she is in certain respects. Vivian, relatively new to Los Angeles and the business, still has to look and act the part, with Edward, beyond giving her money, leaving her largely to her own devices to do so. So she gets a somewhat unlikely Henry Higgins in Barney Thompson, the manager of the Beverly Wilshire Hotel where Edward is staying. Barney has to draw that fine line of keeping the hotel's upscale clients happy, while maintaining the posh decorum of the upper class, which does not include people coming into the hotel looking for rooms with hourly rates. As Barney and his associates are able to transform Vivian into a Cinderella, the questions become whether Vivian can go back to her Hollywood Boulevard life and whether she does have her Prince Charming beyond this week in the form of Edward or anyone else who truly does see her as Cinderella as opposed to a Hollywood Boulevard streetwalker.",English,United States,Nominated for 1 Oscar. 8 wins & 11 nominations total,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk2ODQzNDYxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTcyNDg4NjE@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.1/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '64%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '51/100'}]",51,7.1,"378,222",tt0100405,movie,,"$178,406,268",,,True,1990,Pretty Woman,,

She is a wisecracking, showy woman who has always loved music. She, however, only has her current job being hired by her married lover, Vince LaRocca (Harvey Keitel), to sing in his casino's lounge. She learns of Vince's true business as a gangster when she walks in on him killing one of his employees who wronged him. As a witness to the murder, Deloris goes on the run to the police, Lieutenant Eddie Souther (Bill Nunn), who has long been running an operation to get enough evidence to put Vince behind bars, this murder, which could be the metaphorical nail in Vince's coffin. However, Vince has put a contract out on Deloris' life to prevent her from testifying against him. As such, Eddie has to hide her until the trial, which will be at least two months. Where Eddie chooses is St. Katherine's, a poor Catholic parish and convent in a tough neighborhood in San Francisco. The convent's Mother Superior (Dame Maggie Smith) reluctantly takes Deloris in, that reluctance as Deloris is not anywhere near being close to looking or acting like a typical nun. Furthermore, the Mother Superior does not tell any of the sisters Deloris' true identity or the real reason for her being at St. Katherine's. With the Mother Superior cloistering the sisters behind the convent walls to pray for the salvation mostly of down and out of the neighborhood while keeping the sisters safe from harms of the outside world, there is an immediate and continual clash of wills between her and Deloris. Deloris, as renamed Sister Mary Clarence, does have an effect on two of the sisters, Mary Patrick (Kathy Najimy), a perpetually perky woman, and Mary Robert (Wendy Makkena), who always feels left behind in whatever is happening in life. The clash between Deloris and the Mother Superior leads to the Mother Superior restricting Deloris to one task at the convent, one that leads to good and bad changes at St. Katherine's, the bad most specifically in potentially leading Vince and his associates to Deloris. Those changes also bring the battle of wills between Deloris and Mother Superior to a head, unless each can see the positive in what is happening in relation to their life at the convent.",English,United States,9 wins & 10 nominations total,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzOTU0ODItMzcyMi00YzFjLTk3MzktNTQ2YjZmN2E0NTBkXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.5/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '73%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '51/100'}]",51,6.5,"111,802",tt0105417,movie,,"$139,605,150",,,True,1992,Sister Act,,

Her outwardly perfect and stable life takes an unexpected turn when her husband files for divorce. He wants to marry the woman with whom he is having an affair. Frances supported her husband financially as he was writing his own book, and he sues her for alimony despite her financial difficulties. And he wants to keep the house. Frances eventually accepts her best friend Patti's offer of a vacation, a gay tour of Tuscany which Patti and her lesbian partner Grace originally purchased for themselves before Patti found out that she is pregnant. The gift is a means to escape dealing with the divorce, from which Patti feels Frances may never recover emotionally without some intervention. Feeling that Patti's assessment may be correct in that she has too much emotional baggage ever to return to San Francisco, Frances, while in Tuscany, impulsively ditches the tour to purchase an aged villa, which ends up being a fixer-upper. Frances has many obstacles in eking out a productive and happy life in her new surroundings, that happy life which she hopes will eventually include rediscovering romantic love. In a discussion with sympathetic real estate agent Signor Martini, Frances outlines what emotionally she wants to accomplish with the villa, despite none of those items in a substantive material sense currently being in her life. In response, Martini tells her the story of a set of railroad tracks that were laid between Vienna and Venice before an engine that could make the trek being built, a train which now regularly travels the route. The question becomes whether Frances, in going through the process, will be laying another Vienna to Venice track, and if so whether that end product emotionally will be exactly as she envisions.","English, Italian, Polish, French, Spanish, German","United States, Italy",5 nominations,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIxZTY1ODktM2E3Yi00ZmQxLWI1ZjctNmVkYWQ0MTExMDBlXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.7/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '62%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '52/100'}]",52,6.7,"61,833",tt0328589,movie,,"$43,610,723",,,True,2003,Under the Tuscan Sun,,

McKenzie, Mary-Louise Parker","A dramatization of the real life San Francisco centered fight for LGBT rights from 1972 to 2015 is presented, the LGBT community which arguably has had the most numerous organized campaigns against them of any minority group to suppress those rights in the United States during that time period. It focuses on the advocacy and other supportive work of four individuals, Cleve Jones, Roma Guy, Diane Jones and Ken Jones, whose experiences focus on different aspects of the issue. Cleve's story focuses primarily on the political and legislative fight for gay and ultimately LGBT rights. Roma's story focuses primarily on her fight for women's rights, especially safe places for women, within that where she as a lesbian fits, ultimately a fight for universal health care in San Francisco, and her personal relationships particularly with Diane. Beyond that relationship with Roma, Diane's story focuses on her work as a nurse in caring for AIDS patients, and her want as a lesbian to have a child. And Ken's story focuses on his search for the LGBT community's place within organized religion, and his longtime relationship with child welfare worker Richard, who hid behind a heterosexual marriage to protect his livelihood. Key events and the LGBT community reaction to these events in this collective fight are presented, such as the Equal Rights Amendment movement, the push to get gay Harvey Milk elected to San Francisco public office (he who would be the first openly homosexual person to hold public office in the US), the vote on Proposition 6 in California in conjunction with singer and Florida orange juice spokesperson Anita Bryant's anti-gay crusade, the murders of Milk and San Francisco mayor George Moscone, the AIDS crisis, the AIDS memorial quilt which was not supported by the entire gay community, the disillusionment with President Bill Clinton's administration with ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" and the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) enacted under his watch, and the vote on Proposition 8 in California which ultimately led to a fight at the United States Supreme Court for complete civil rights for the LGBT community throughout the nation.",English,United States,2 wins & 2 nominations,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjIyMjM5MTE2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc5MTEyMTI@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.5/10'}]",,7.5,"3,425",tt5292622,series,,,,,True,2017,When We Rise,,1
